# Start to Go

This repo is intended to host a small introduction course to the Go programming language.  
The audience for the course is for developers new to Go or other people with basic programming knowledge who want to learn Go.  
After going through the course the students should be able to write a basic Go program, know where to look when creating more complex programs and know what to do to make it production ready (testing, documentation, ...)

The course is written in the [course.md file](./course.md)  
This file contains the main content of the course and is intended to also serve as a reference manual for students after the course.
